# React-ecommerce
Coding Ninja's React Skill test Project

#Instructions
        Use the following service to create a dummy ecommerce api service (create good amount of data): https://my-json-server.typicode.com/

#Functionality:

    #Navbar
        Show cart items count
        Show relevant navigation links
        
    #All products page
        Show list of products from the API (using the above server)
        Each product is editable by clicking on the “pencil” button. And we can edit that product inline. On finish editing the product, show some sort of Alert/Notification
        Each product is deletable, on clicking of the delete button you should delete the product and show some sort of Alert/Notification
        Implement a sort button. On clicking it should sort by “price” and show a cross button just beside it (see the sort view). On clicking the cross button remove the sort.
        Give button to add a product to cart
        
    #Create page
        On clicking of the Add button add the product in the DB, and show some sort of Alert/Notification
        
    #Product detail page
        Show all the details of a product
        Give button to add a product to cart
        
    #Cart page
        Show all the items in the cart
        Handle errors and success alerts etc.
        Handle errors as well from the API and show appropriate Alert/Notification
        You can use react-router if you want. It’s not mandatory.
        You have to use redux. It’s mandatory.
        
    #Bonus feature: Make the redux data persistent such that after refresh, the cart items etc remains same
